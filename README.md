# Viewer for MuJoCo in Python

Interactive renderer to use with the official Python bindings for MuJoCo 2.2.x

## Points to ponder:
> This repo is/will-be a modified / custom version of https://github.com/rohanpsingh/mujoco-python-viewer 
> Additional credits: I do see a lot of similar structure as used in `mjviewer` from mujoco-py, so I will also give credits to https://github.com/openai/mujoco-py/blob/master/mujoco_py/mjviewer.py
> Starting with version 2.1.2, MuJoCo comes with native Python bindings officially supported by the MuJoCo devs.  
> If you have been a user of `mujoco-py`, you might be looking to migrate.  
> Some pointers on migration are available [here](https://mujoco.readthedocs.io/en/latest/python.html#migration-notes-for-mujoco-py).
